    "Online learning For all tasks, we initialize all the agents with random weights and learn online only. Training an agent for 150 epochs takes about 3 minutes on a single CPU core (Intel I7-4870HQ). In contrast, previous approaches using active inference [Ueltzhöffer, 2018, Tschantz et al., 2019, 2020] and policy gradient methods (e.g., [Liu et al., 2017]) use (offline) policy replay and typically need hours of GPU-accelerated compute while achieving similar convergence. To our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL method to learn online using neural network representations. This is afforded by the high sample efficiency of the FEEF, which directs exploration towards states that are uncertain for both the encoder and transition models.\n",
